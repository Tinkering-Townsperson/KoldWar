You are in the nuclear bunker. The walls are made of drab white concrete.
Hanging on the east wall are flags of the communist states of the world, 
including The Republic of Cuba, The Federal Republic of East Germany,
and The People's Republic of China, forever comrades to The USSR.
On the north wall there is a ladder leading to a trapdoor with a one-way window.
